# What is this?

I'm testing webpack svg sprite packages. So far I have discovered these:

- https://github.com/mrsum/webpack-svgstore-plugin
- https://github.com/kisenka/svg-sprite-loader

webpack-svgstore-plugin seems like the more mature option, but svg-sprite-loader seems to be closer to the spirit of webpack.

# How to run?

```
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```
